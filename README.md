# JCI Nigeria Event Static Website.

## Overview:

Building of this website is a call to action of getting a mobile responsive website for a youth development, not for profit and non govermental organisation event. This is to market the upcoming organisation event in Nigeria to the entire world. JCI is a nonprofit organization of young active citizens age 18 to 40 who are engaged and committed to creating impact in their communities. Active citizens are individuals invested in the future of our world. Junior Chamber International (JCI) with head quarter in USA, gathers active citizens from all sectors of society. We develop the skills, knowledge and understanding to make informed decisions and take action.
Been a past chapter president of this organisation and a member of the host chapter of this year event gave me an insight to the need of this static website for the event.
The website is basically to inform the public about the upcoming organisation National Convention both for registration and hotel booking.

## UX
It was a desire by the organisation to a mobile friendly event planning website and this helped in choosing a mobile first design for the project. The layout was planned using balsamiq wireframing uploaded in wireframe folder and on this link for a limited time(https://balsamiq.cloud/st8pqbr/py93qxc).
Users can easy manouver around the site via different types of devices and desktop. Index.html been the home page can lead the users either to register for the event, reserve hotel for the event or basically look for more information on the event.

## Features

* Home Page is the landing page for the project which links other area a user might want to visit on the project.
* About Page basically talks about the organisation and introduce the event.
* Program Page talks about what the users or participants should expect during the forthcoming event.
* Accommodation Page gives detail information of all the hotel choice for the event and how to reserve a room.
* Contact Page gives contact detail for the organisation and of the Director in charge of the event.
* Registration Page gives registration detail and if the user decides to register, gives the link to the secure form on the main organisation website (external to this project) to register.
* The footer section of all the pages contain both link to facebook and twitter page of the event. 

## Features Left to Implement

* I would love to implement a secure member section if this is not a basic static project. 

## Tech Used

### Some of the tech used includes:

* HTML
Base languages used to create app
* CSS and Boothstrap
Used to style the website.
* Cloud 9 - Used to build the project.
* Github and Github Pages - Used to track the progress of the project, and host the site for submission.

## Testing

* Site viewed and tested in the following browsers:
Google Chrome and Safari
* Pages were inspected to test responsiveness for best user experience both on desktop and mobile devices.
* All the links external to the site were also tested to ensure that they actually landed on the expected pages.

## Credits
